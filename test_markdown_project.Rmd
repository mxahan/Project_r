## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
card <- read.csv("CarPrice_Assignment.csv")
coln <- colnames(card)
print(coln)
```

## Including Plots for the greater good

You can also embed plots, for example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(card$aspiration, card$price)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Chapter 2 Codes
Code run for available

```{r pressure}
# as.factor for categorical variables are important
attach(card)
plot(as.factor(car_ID), price, col='red')
hist(price)
plot(~wheelbase+as.factor(fuelsystem)+car_ID, card)
```

```{r pressure}
attach(card)
names(card)
plot(as.factor(wheelbase), price)
#identify(wheelbase)
dim(card)
summary(card)
```
