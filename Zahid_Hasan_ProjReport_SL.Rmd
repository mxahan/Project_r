## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
card <- read.csv("CarPrice_Assignment.csv")
coln <- colnames(card)
print(coln)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(card$cylindernumber, card$price)
```
```{r}
summary(card)
```
```{r}
hist(card$price, col = 2, breaks = 20)
```


```{r}
d1=read.table("student-mat.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE)
d2=read.table("student-por.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE)

d3=merge(d1,d2,by=c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet"))
print(nrow(d3)) # 382 students
summary(d2)
```
```{r}
hist(d2$G3, col =2, breaks = 20)
```
```{r}
hrp <- read.csv("framingham.csv")
summary(hrp)
```
```{r}
hist(hrp$TenYearCHD, col =2, breaks=15)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
